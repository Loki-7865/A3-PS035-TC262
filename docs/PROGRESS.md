# NETSCOPE progress — 31 October 2026

## Current milestone
My Investigations, Phase A and Phase B are committed and pushed. Phase B is
`8d1bb28` on origin/main. Phase C was committed and pushed as `bae01be`.
Phase D (`b234853`) and Phase E (`fa39780`) are committed and pushed to origin/main.
Phase F account settings are verified and approved for commit/push on 31 October 2026.
PDF output verification and production account cleanup guarantees remain open.
Existing work was preserved throughout. No production records were deleted and no
deployment was performed. See the Git milestones below for approved commits.

## Architecture audit
- Existing React/Vite frontend: public landing/demo, Firebase Auth session provider,
  protected workspace, per-user Firestore snapshots and detailed reports.
- Four demo fixtures retained unchanged. Healthy fixture omits evidence; the save
  service now treats absent evidence as an empty list.
- Snapshot JSON remains backward compatible; metadata-only records are visible.
- Flask exposes health, telemetry, diagnosis, incidents and privileged refresh.
  Original audit: refresh calls Docker telemetry collection and lacked token verification.
  Phase C adds authentication and disables administrative refresh by default.
  Incident GET reads history; collection/refresh is the path that updates history.
- No checked-in Firestore rules found. Deployed owner rules are not verified.
- Baseline build passed with a large bundle warning; baseline lint had seven errors.

## Completed
- History batches of 25, cursor pagination, ten visible matches at a time.
- Explicit search/filter/sort scope: all loaded records, not merely visible cards.
  Load more to extend the scope; entire archive is stated only after exhaustion.
- Document-ID pagination includes legacy documents missing createdAt. Newest/oldest
  sorting is over loaded records; batches are NOT globally newest-first.
- Search title, scenario ID/name, source and available fault classifications.
- Source/scenario/status/date filters; newest/oldest/title sorting.
- Metadata, counts, unknown values, simulated provenance and report links.
- Owner-scoped deletion, named confirmation, Escape/cancel, repeated-submit guard,
  success feedback, failure retention and removal from the local loaded list.
- Navigation from workspace, details, and successful save.
- Responsive styles and reduced-motion/focus treatment.
- Existing lint failures corrected: unused imports, auth hook separated from provider,
  redundant synchronous state updates removed from protected pages.

## Resume verification and fixes
- Process inspection: no fixture/test process running after interruption. Two existing
  Vite servers were left untouched. The separate fixture server used loopback port 5180.
- Fixed fixture server missing Vite React preamble via transformIndexHtml.
- Fixed deletion focus restoration: move focus after dialog closes, to Saved reports.
- Removed trailing blank line identified by git diff --check.

## Exact check results
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: PASS, exit 0, no errors/warnings.
- `npm --prefix frontend test`: PASS, 9 tests, 0 failed/skipped. Node 22.16.0 emits
  an experimental-module-mocking notice; no test dependency added.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: PASS, exit 0, 1969 modules. JS 920.43 kB
  (277.72 kB gzip), CSS 59.22 kB. Existing >500 kB chunk warning remains.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`: PASS, 2 tests.
- `git diff --check`: initially found AuthContext trailing blank line; corrected;
  final check PASS.
- Browser checks against isolated in-memory fixtures: PASS for initial loading,
  25-to-31 record pagination, 10-to-20 visible results, search across loaded batches,
  source/scenario filters, oldest/title sorting, clear filters, legacy metadata,
  unknown counts/date, empty archive, load failure/retry, deletion confirmation,
  Escape cancellation, successful deletion, failure retention, disabled repeat submit,
  focus restored to Saved reports, date range filtering and invalid-range alert.
- Viewport checks: 320, 390, 768 and 1280 px iframe viewports, no horizontal document
  overflow. At scrollbars: content/client widths were 375/375, 753/753, 1265/1265;
  320 narrow viewport measured 320/320. Mobile layout visually inspected.
- Date test automation initially filled native fields without React updates; native
  ArrowUp changes exercised the real handler and confirmed filtering/validation.
- UI fixture loads no Firebase module or real account. Real sign-in, deployed Firestore
  permissions, cross-user security enforcement and real backend remain UNVERIFIED.

## Reproduce
From repository root:

```sh
npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix frontend run build
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
node frontend/tests/ui-preview.mjs
```

Fixture URLs: `http://127.0.0.1:5180/`, `/?empty`, `/?load-error`, `/?delete-error`.
Viewport harness: `/tests/viewport.html?width=390` (also 320, 768, 1280).
These files are outside the production entry point and are not copied by Vite build.

## Remaining limitations and next step
- History uses on-demand reads, not a live listener. Changes in other tabs require
  revisiting/reloading. Local deletion updates immediately after server success.
- Search/sort become archive-wide only after all batches are loaded; no backend
  full-text index is present. Full snapshots are downloaded with each batch.
- Dashboard now uses a five-document listener and aggregate counts; see Phase A below.
- Rules must be checked/tested in an authorized Firebase emulator/project before
  claiming deployed owner isolation. Frontend path checks are not a security boundary.
- Next: demo refinements and secure read-only Live
  Mode; route splitting to address the bundle warning. No live API/public deployment
  before authentication/authorization and privileged-route isolation are implemented.


## Phase A — Dashboard navigation and operational polish

### Implemented
- Responsive sidebar/navigation with Overview, My Investigations, Demo lab and Live
  connection status; visible navigation on mobile and a keyboard skip link.
- Quick actions for the public demo, saved investigations and live availability.
- Five newest dated investigations in a cleaned-up report list, with View All.
  Undated legacy reports remain accessible in the archive and are counted in totals.
- Firestore aggregate queries for total/Demo/Live counts. No history-wide document
  download. Source-less records are included in total, not invented as Live records.
- Counts are server reads on entry/Refresh workspace, with the check time displayed.
  They are not advertised as a continuously synchronized transactional snapshot.
- Recent reports retain a bounded real-time listener and show cached-data provenance.
- Independent count/list errors, refresh/retry, skeletons, empty/legacy onboarding.
- Account provider and email-verification information, broken-photo initials fallback,
  logout progress/repeat-submit guard and error recovery.
- Live action goes to the actual disconnected status panel, not an unimplemented
  route. Backend availability is explicitly not checked, no telemetry is fabricated,
  and no privileged Flask endpoint is called.

### Files for this phase
- Created: `frontend/src/services/dashboard.js`, `frontend/src/styles/Dashboard.css`,
  `frontend/tests/dashboard.test.mjs`.
- Updated: `frontend/src/pages/UserDashboard.jsx`, fixture server/viewport harness,
  and this progress document. Existing investigations changes remain intact.

### Verification on 26 October 2026
- Lint: PASS, exit 0, no errors/warnings.
- Frontend tests: PASS, 13 total (9 existing + 4 dashboard service tests), 0 failures.
  New coverage: aggregate owner paths and all-record totals, five-document listener,
  cache metadata, cleanup, permission failures and session-switch protection.
- Build: PASS, 1971 modules, JS 927.06 kB (279.46 kB gzip), CSS 66.05 kB.
  Existing >500 kB bundle warning remains; not suppressed.
- Python tests: PASS, 2 tests. `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Synthetic browser checks: populated metrics/five reports, broken image fallback,
  new-user onboarding, legacy-only archive messaging, count failure/retry, recent-list
  failure with working counts, cached empty data, logout failure and success routing
  to `/login`, Live status anchor. All PASS.
- Viewports: 320/390/768/1280 px checked; content width matched client width with no
  horizontal document overflow. Mobile and desktop layouts visually inspected.
- Production sign-in, Firestore aggregate permissions and deployed security rules
  remain unverified; UI checks use fixtures with no production data access.
- Test fixture server stopped after checks; other development servers untouched.

### Git milestones
- User explicitly approved separate feature commits and push to `origin/main`.
- `b5a34ba`: feat: add saved investigation management.
- `d77a420`: feat: polish dashboard navigation and operational summaries.
- Push succeeded: `14e3ea9..d77a420 main -> main`; local origin/main also resolves
  to d77a42045ce181e4edac9714e2f783b65134b2de. No force push or history rewriting.
- Phase B was subsequently approved, committed as `8d1bb28`, and pushed to origin/main.

## Phase B — Demo enhancements

### Completed
- Added independent static scenario loader and request-keyed hook. Changes and reloads
  invalidate old data during render, before effects; aborted responses cannot replace
  the selected snapshot. Failed/loading requests cannot show false healthy results.
- Reset to healthy and reload controls clear selection; provenance explains that reload
  reads a prerecorded fixture, not fresh diagnosis/telemetry. Missing timestamps stay
  unavailable. All four JSON fixtures and schemas are unchanged.
- Router nodes and links support keyboard and pointer inspection. Wider SVG hit targets,
  selected-state cues, focus on inspection, focus return on close, and corrected node/link
  geometry improve usability. Mobile status labels remain visible, not color-only.
- Router context exposes recorded collection status, findings, adjacent links and cited
  peer evidence. Link context distinguishes recorded physical/BGP state; absent details
  are not inferred as facts.
- Selected evidence is highlighted in the full timeline using direct associations and
  explicit evidence IDs. Multiple faults keep their evidence/hypotheses separate.
- Findings distinguish physical observations, routing observations, and possible downstream
  BGP symptoms where a physical-link hypothesis exists. No invented confidence scores.
- Subtle selection/hover transitions and reduced-motion support; no invented traffic.
- Save uses the exact clicked snapshot, guards repeated submissions, handles permission
  failures, and links directly to the saved report. Old completion feedback is discarded
  after scenario/session changes. Public users are directed to login before saving.

### Files
Created: `frontend/src/services/demoScenarios.js`, `frontend/src/hooks/useDemoScenario.js`,
`frontend/src/styles/DemoEnhancements.css`, `frontend/tests/demo.test.mjs`.
Modified: DemoDashboard, SaveInvestigation, isolated fixture/viewport harness, this log.

### Final checks
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: PASS, exit 0, no errors/warnings.
- `npm --prefix frontend test`: PASS, 19 tests, 0 failed/skipped (six new demo tests).
  Node experimental module-mocking notice remains.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: PASS, 1974 modules. JS 931.90 kB (280.82 kB gzip),
  CSS 68.89 kB. Existing >500 kB bundle warning remains and is not suppressed.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`: PASS, 2 tests.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Browser fixtures: all four scenarios rendered; rapid switching, delayed reload hiding
  old snapshots/disabled Save, keyboard link/router inspection, map pointer hit targets,
  selected evidence counts, router peer evidence, close focus, reset, HTTP 503 failure,
  recovery, public demo/login navigation, permission-denied save/retry and saved report
  link all PASS. Multiple faults: physical link highlights five evidence records;
  routing context has six. Successful save during reset retained multiple_faults and
  eleven evidence records, one request; no stale saved badge on the new scenario.
- Responsive checks: 320/390/768/1280 px, no horizontal document overflow; mobile
  topology visually reviewed. R4/R5 spacing and link-to-node alignment corrected.
- UI save tests use an in-memory fixture service. Production Firebase writes, deployed
  rules and real authentication remain unverified. No VM/Docker/privileged API calls.
- Fixture server stopped after checks. Existing development servers left untouched.

### Remaining limitations / next step
- Existing login flow still lands on the dashboard; returning directly to a selected
  scenario after sign-in is a future authentication-flow refinement.
- Phase B does not add live telemetry. Secure Live Mode must first add server-side token
  verification/authorization and isolate privileged refresh from the public API.
- Approved commit `8d1bb28 feat: enhance demo inspection and snapshot safety`
  was pushed to origin/main; remote advanced from d77a420 to 8d1bb28.

## Phase C — Secure read-only Live Mode (27 October 2026)

### Completed and pushed as bae01be
- Added protected Live workspace and dashboard navigation, stored topology/router
  inspection, BGP observations, correlated causes/evidence, estimated impact and
  stored incident history. API reachability is separate from telemetry freshness.
- Added Firebase Admin ID-token verification with revocation checks, explicit
  project and UID authorization, exact-origin CORS, no-store headers and fail-closed
  authentication errors. Legacy data routes now require bearer authorization.
- Added read-only `/api/live/snapshot`, explicit telemetry storage configuration,
  bounded file reads and sanitized output. Tests assert no collection, save or
  incident update is called. Physical link state remains unmeasured.
- Administrative refresh disabled by default, requires additional admin authorization
  when enabled, and rejects browser Origin requests. Development server is loopback-only.
- Added HTTPS-only client configuration (loopback exception), token/response session
  guards, timeout/abort handling, disabled redirects/cookies and optional visible-page
  polling. Access denial clears data; connection loss retains a labeled last snapshot.
- Fixed unknown-time handling: the browser now preserves the backend's unknown
  freshness classification even when it can parse the timestamp locally.
- Added `requirements.txt`, backend/client tests and `docs/LIVE_MODE.md` with
  configuration, proposed ingress boundary and deployment/integration limitations.

### Final checks
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: PASS, exit 0, no lint diagnostics.
- `npm --prefix frontend test`: PASS, 27 tests, 0 failures/skipped; experimental
  Node module-mocking notice remains. Includes eight Live API client tests.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: PASS, 1977 modules; existing >500 kB JS
  chunk warning remains. No warning suppression added.
- `/private/tmp/netscope-live-venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests`:
  PASS, 11 tests (nine new security/read-only API tests), no failures.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Isolated browser fixtures: PASS for stale snapshot, router filtering, link-related
  evidence, denied access with polling disabled, unconfigured controls disabled,
  connection loss retaining labeled last-known data, and polling checkbox toggle.
- Responsive harness checked 320/390/768/1280 px frames with no horizontal content
  overflow reported; mobile and desktop screenshots reviewed. Browser fixture uses
  synthetic services, not actual Firebase tokens or VM data. Timed background polling
  and deployed end-to-end auth were not exercised in the browser.
- Fixture server stopped after checks. Existing changes preserved; Phase C was
  approved, committed and pushed as bae01be. No deployment, production writes, VM/Docker operations or fault injection.

### Approval / remaining activation
- User approved commit `feat: add authenticated read-only live monitoring`
  and push to origin/main on 27 October 2026.
- Real ADC credentials, Firebase token validation, authorized UID/origin configuration,
  HTTPS ingress and VM integration need operator verification before activation.
  No tunnel or public API exposure was provisioned.


## Phase D — Fault Investigation Workspace (27 October 2026)

### Completed
- Added protected `/dashboard/investigate`, linked from the dashboard sidebar and
  Live workspace. Source/scenario selection, explicit start, captured result,
  context inspection, investigative guidance and save form one workflow.
- Demo reviews unchanged prerecorded diagnoses. Live calls the existing authenticated
  read-only snapshot endpoint, which computes diagnosis from stored telemetry. No
  collection, active probes, commands or fault injection were added.
- Results are detached from loader updates. Source/scenario/session changes unmount
  the run, cancel pending reads and clear old results. Starting again removes the
  prior saveable snapshot. Observation, review-start and capture times remain distinct.
- Router/link context correlates findings, hypotheses and evidence, including backend
  peer observations. Multiple independent demo faults retain separate evidence sets.
  Full-result impact is labeled separately from filtered context. No confidence scores.
- Suggested investigative steps are explicitly unexecuted operator recommendations.
  Missing observations, incomplete collection and uncertainty remain visible.
- Extended existing save service for Live provenance and capture metadata, preserving
  old demo snapshots and JSON format. Saves require matching current UID and reject
  snapshots exceeding 800,000 UTF-8 bytes. Explicit Live save describes the copy into
  private Firestore history. No automatic writes.
- Report viewer retains capture provenance and supports backend incident field names;
  estimated Live impact is no longer labeled confirmed physical-link failure.
- Browser review fixed a shared 320px minimum-width overflow with classic scrollbars;
  html/body now shrink to the available viewport. Updated viewport harness reports
  body width as well as document width.

### Files
Created: `frontend/src/pages/FaultInvestigation.jsx`,
`frontend/src/services/faultInvestigation.js`,
`frontend/src/styles/FaultInvestigation.css`,
`frontend/tests/faultInvestigation.test.mjs`.
Modified: App routing, UserDashboard navigation, LiveMonitoring navigation,
InvestigationDetails, investigations save service, index.css, investigation tests,
isolated UI/viewport harness and progress documentation.

### Verification
- Frontend lint: PASS, no diagnostics.
- Frontend tests: PASS, 34 tests, 0 failed/skipped (seven new Phase D tests).
  Covers all four demo results, snapshot detachment, independent fault evidence,
  Live normalization, cancellation/session changes, errors, uncertainty guidance,
  Live save provenance and payload limits. Existing module-mocking notice remains.
- Production build: PASS; existing >500 kB bundle warning remains.
- Backend unittest suite: PASS, 11 tests; backend implementation unchanged in Phase D.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Browser fixture: multiple-fault result shows five findings/two causes/eleven evidence
  records; R2-R4 selection shows three findings/one cause/five evidence records.
  Saving this filtered view preserved all eleven evidence records, one request,
  and displayed the saved report link. Source switching cleared the previous result.
- Browser fixture: Live stored-snapshot result, physical-state uncertainty, stale
  label and operator guidance render; permission-denied save remains retryable;
  offline Live returns error with no result/save action. Healthy snapshot correctly
  shows absent observation time and no-evidence caveats.
- Responsive checks at 320/390/768/1280px frame widths report no document/body overflow.
  Populated 320px workflow and desktop layout visually reviewed.

### Boundaries / next action
- All UI/service tests use synthetic or mocked services. No production Firestore
  writes or auth configuration changes. Deployed owner rules and real Firebase/VM
  integration remain unverified, as documented in LIVE_MODE.md.
- Phase D committed as `b234853` after user approval on 31 October 2026:
  `feat: add evidence-based fault investigation workspace` and push to origin/main.
- Next development phase after approval: Phase E Reports and Export.


## Phase E — Reports and Export (31 October 2026)

### Implemented
- Report tools on saved investigation details: metadata-only by default, explicit
  section selection for findings/hypotheses, evidence, incidents, impact and saved
  operator notes. Prepare a visible preview before downloading JSON or printing.
- JSON uses a versioned report format with source, observation/capture/save/export
  times and uncertainty disclaimer. Export is a selected report, not a full backup.
  An allowlist excludes arbitrary fields, raw telemetry, credentials and config.
  Selected free-text may still contain sensitive content; review before sharing.
- Print stylesheet prints only the prepared preview. Print / Save as PDF invokes
  the browser dialog; no external export service or new PDF dependency. The user
  chooses Save as PDF. Actual PDF pagination/output has NOT yet been verified.
- Notes use owner-scoped updateDoc and modify only notes/notesUpdatedAt, with a
  10,000-character limit, duplicate-submit guard and retained draft on failure.
  Exports include saved notes only. Writes replace notes (last write wins); no
  collaborative editing or conflict merging. Original evidence is unchanged.
- Details are keyed by account/report to clear the old result immediately during
  session/navigation changes; document ID comes from Firestore rather than payload.
- Existing legacy metadata reports and malformed JSON can still export metadata.
  No migrations, production writes, Firebase rule changes or deployment performed.

### Files
Added `frontend/src/components/ReportTools.jsx`, `frontend/src/styles/ReportTools.css`,
`frontend/src/utils/reportExport.js`, `frontend/src/services/reportNotes.js` and
`frontend/tests/reportExport.test.mjs`. Updated InvestigationDetails and the isolated
UI/viewport harness, retaining every existing Phase D change.

### Verification
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: PASS, no diagnostics.
- `npm --prefix frontend test`: PASS, 41 tests, 0 failures/skipped. Seven new tests
  cover opt-in fields, credential-field exclusion, legacy/corrupt snapshots, Live
  provenance, filenames and owner-scoped/validated notes writes. Node experimental
  module-mocking warning remains.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: PASS, 1984 modules; JS 964.23 kB (289.31 kB gzip),
  CSS 73.16 kB. Existing >500 kB bundle warning remains.
- Backend tests initially could not run because the prior temporary virtualenv had
  expired and system Python lacked firebase_admin. Recreated the temporary venv and
  installed existing requirements; final unittest run: PASS, 11 tests.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Browser synthetic fixture: saved notes success; permission denial preserves draft;
  selected metadata/notes preview; full selected report with 5 findings, 2 hypotheses,
  11 evidence records and 2 incidents; JSON download action feedback all verified.
  JSON payload content verified in unit tests; downloaded file not inspected in UI.
- Responsive fixture: 320/390/768/1280px frames, no horizontal document/body overflow.
- Print click blocked embedded-browser control; the app containing its dialog is
  unavailable to computer-use tools. Closed the temporary tab. PDF output/pagination
  remains a manual browser verification item; do not claim verified PDF delivery.
- Fixture server stopped after checks. Optional comparison is deferred.

### Approval / next step
- User approved both commits and push on 31 October 2026. Phase D is `b234853`.
- Approved Phase E commit message:
  `feat: add reviewed report exports and operator notes`.
- Complete a browser Save as PDF check before release. Real Firestore rule permission
  for notes updates and real Live/Firebase integration remain unverified.
- Next implementation phase: Phase F Account and Workspace Settings.


## Phase F — Account and Workspace Settings (31 October 2026)

### Completed locally
- Protected account settings with display-name editing, current photo removal,
  initials fallback and authenticated profile refresh across the workspace.
- Provider-aware controls: Google-only accounts do not expose password change;
  email/password changes reauthenticate before mutation. Linked providers supported.
- Email verification request/status refresh; public reset page with generic delivery
  feedback and login link. Passwords cleared from settings state after operations.
- Typed DELETE confirmation, focus management, same-identity reauthentication and
  server-only empty-workspace checks before Auth deletion. Existing records never
  bulk-deleted. Remaining reports/profile data, offline reads and permission errors
  block deletion. No real account operations were executed during development.
- Session guards before/after asynchronous identity verification, duplicate-operation
  guard, mapped provider errors and safe feedback. Current user/profile context refresh.
- Added `docs/ACCOUNT_SETTINGS.md` with cleanup strategy and release limitations.

### Files
Created AccountSettings.jsx, ResetPassword.jsx, services/account.js,
styles/AccountSettings.css and tests/account.test.mjs. Updated App routes,
AuthContext, Login reset link, UserDashboard navigation and isolated UI harness.

### Checks
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: PASS, no diagnostics.
- `npm --prefix frontend test`: PASS, 51 tests, 0 failed/skipped; ten new account tests.
  Includes provider handling, owner/name validation, password checks/reauthentication,
  account-switch race, empty/nonempty account deletion, offline failure and safe errors.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: PASS, 1988 modules; JS 978.78 kB (292.96 kB gzip),
  CSS 74.08 kB. Existing >500 kB bundle warning remains.
- Python unittest discovery in temporary venv: PASS, 11 tests. Backend unchanged.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Synthetic browser UI: Google-only password guidance, profile update, verification
  request and status refresh, typed deletion confirmation, remaining-data block,
  cancel focus restoration, password mismatch/success feedback and generic public
  reset feedback all PASS. No real emails, credentials or deletion used.
- Responsive 320/390/768/1280px frames show no horizontal document/body overflow;
  desktop settings screenshot reviewed. Fixture server stopped after checks.

### Limitations and next step
- Empty-account deletion is guarded for the current schema, not an atomic cleanup
  guarantee: concurrent writes or unknown subcollections require trusted server
  cleanup and deployed write-blocking rules. Production cleanup remains open.
- Real Firebase email delivery, recent-login enforcement, Google popups, project
  password policy and deployed owner rules need disposable-project integration tests.
- User approved `feat: add provider-aware account settings and recovery`
  and push to origin/main on 31 October 2026.
- Next roadmap phase: Phase G UI/UX polish. Phase E PDF verification remains open.

## Phases G, H, I and J — combined delivery (31 October 2026)

Status: implemented locally, awaiting approval for one combined commit and push.
Phase F was committed and pushed as `bf27cfb` before this work.

### G — UI and accessibility polish
- Shared visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion CSS, improved auth contrast and
  underlined links; mobile input sizing and persistent signup password guidance.
- Announced session/loading states and busy auth forms; accessible route loading
  and recovery view with reload/home actions.
- Synthetic Login/Signup fixture added. Both pages verified at 320, 390, 768 and
  1280px: document/body widths match their available frame widths, no overflow.
- Synthetic invalid login displays mapped error; keyboard focus outline visible.
  No real sign-in, mail or account mutation was performed. Reduced-motion CSS was
  reviewed; OS preference and screen-reader behavior have not been tested.

### H — performance
- Lazy imports for every route; Auth initialization separated from Firestore so
  database code loads with routes that need it. Existing service facade preserved.
- Production entry JS reduced from 978.78 kB (292.96 gzip) to 374.56 kB
  (116.81 gzip), about 62% smaller. Deferred Firebase chunk 468.82 kB; page chunks
  1.52–26.56 kB. Entry CSS 3.92 kB. No oversized-chunk warning or threshold change.
- These are build artifact sizes, not measured network latency/Lighthouse scores.

### I — regression coverage
- Eight new regression cases cover account changes during deletion preflight,
  failed reauthentication, UTF-8 save limits, detached saved snapshots, session
  changes during response reads, cancellation, malformed responses and missing auth.
- Frontend tests: PASS, 59 tests, 0 failures/cancelled/skipped (exit 0).
- Backend tests: PASS, 11 tests (exit 0), temporary isolated Python environment.
- Frontend lint: PASS (exit 0), rerun after fixture additions.
- Production build: PASS (exit 0), 1990 modules; no chunk warning.
- `git diff --check`: PASS (exit 0).

### J — deployment preparation
- Added root Firebase Hosting configuration with SPA fallback and conservative
  cache/security headers, ignored CLI state, public environment template, and
  GitHub Actions frontend/backend checks. CI does not deploy or use credentials.
- Added DEPLOYMENT.md covering explicit project selection, HTTPS/authorized domains,
  separate environments, API ingress, release smoke checks and rollback.
- Configuration is prepared only: Firebase CLI hosting validation and remote CI
  execution have not run. No public deployment or production rule change occurred.
- Remaining release gates: real Firebase/Auth/rules integration, trusted atomic
  account cleanup, browser PDF output, real-device accessibility, production Live
  ingress and post-deploy verification. See DEPLOYMENT.md and ACCOUNT_SETTINGS.md.
- Local synthetic fixture stopped after verification. All changes remain uncommitted.

## Submission deployment connection — in progress
- User selected Vercel frontend, Render Free backend, existing Ubuntu lab VM and
  existing Firestore storage; no paid service authorized.
- SSH key connection verified. All five router containers running. VM has only
  about 78 MB free; no cleanup, package installation or reset performed.
- Added authenticated bounded telemetry ingestion, Firestore latest-snapshot read,
  disk-free stdlib VM uploader, Gunicorn dependency and Vercel SPA configuration.
- Backend tests: PASS, 17 tests including six ingestion/storage/auth checks.
  Git whitespace check PASS. Real cloud ingestion is not yet verified.
- Deployment still pending account access, Admin secret provisioning, private
  telemetry Firestore rule verification, approved UID/CORS configuration and
  commit/push approval. No cloud resources or VM uploader started yet.
